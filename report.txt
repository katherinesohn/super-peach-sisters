virtual int init();

Initializes member variables of StudentWorld, reads in level file and adds 
all actors according to level file to vector that keeps track of all actors. 
Peach pointer is stored separately from the vector. Initialize the display 
and return continue to proceed game. This function is virtual because it is 
pure virtual inherited from gameWorld


virtual int move();

carries out one tick of a game. Make peach do something using peach pointer, 
make each actor in the vector do something, checking all the time if peach is 
dead, level is over, or game is over, in which case play the right sound and return the 
right value to the game framework. Removes any newly-dead actors and returns continue
to game framework. This function is virtual because it is pure virtual inherited from gameWorld


virtual void cleanUp();

deletes all actor objects from vector, deletes peach from peach pointer. 
This function is virtual because it is pure virtual inherited from gameWorld


Actor* overlap(Actor* a1, Actor* a2) const;

returns a pointer to a2 if the two actors overlap, otherwise returns a nullptr. const function 
because no modification to the StudentWorld class.


bool overlapsPeach(Actor* a) const;

returns true if a overlaps peach, false otherwise. const function 
because no modification to the StudentWorld class.


Actor* damageableOverlap(Actor* a1) const;

returns pointer to damageable actor (other than peach) overlapping a1
if there is one, otherwise nullptr. const function 
because no modification to the StudentWorld class.


Actor* blockingActorAt(int x, int y) const;

returns pointer to blocking actor overlapping box left bottom corner x,y parameters, 
if doesn't exist, return nullptr. const function 
because no modification to the StudentWorld class.


Peach* getPeach() const;

returns peach pointer. const function 
because no modification to the StudentWorld class.


void addActor(Actor* a1);

adds actor parameter to vector.


void endLevel();

tells StudentWorld that the game is in state where level is over


void endGame();

tells StudentWorld that the game is in state where game is over



////////////////////////////
///	ACTOR
////////////////////////////

virtual void doSomething() = 0;

Every actor does something for one tick. pure virtual function because there is no way to know what 
a general actor will do in their tick. 


virtual void bonk() = 0; 

every actor can be bonked, pure virtual because there is no way to know what a general 
actor will do when bonked, also to make actor an abstract class


StudentWorld* getWorld() const;

returns StudentWorld that actor belongs to, const because does not modify object


bool isPassable() const;

returns false if actor is a blocking object, true otherwise, const because does not modify object


bool isDamageable() const;

returns true if actor is damageable, false otherwise. const because does not modify object


bool isAlive() const;

returns true if actor is alive, false otherwise. const because does not modify object


void setDead();

sets actor as dead. 


void switchDirection();

switches direction left/right of actor 


////////////////////////////////////////
///		PEACH
////////////////////////////////////////

virtual void doSomething();

peach doesn't do anything if dead, otherwise updates powers and moves or shoots based on key input. 
virtual because inherited from Actor

virtual void bonk();

peach loses powers if has any, else dies 


void getStarPower(int ticks);

gives peach star power for ticks number of ticks. regular member function


void getJumpPower(); 

gives peach jump power. regular member function


void getShootPower();

gives peach shoot power. regular member function


void setHitPoints(int hp);

sets peach's hit points to hp. regular member function. 


bool hasStarPower() const; 

returns true if peach has star power, false otherwise. const because no change to actor. 


bool hasJumpPower() const; 

returns true if peach has mushroom power, false otherwise. const because no change to actor. 


bool hasShootPower() const; 

returns true if peach has flower power, false otherwise. const because no change to actor. 


////////////////////////////////////////////
///////		GOODIES 
////////////////////////////////////////////


virtual void doSomething();

if goodie is overlapping peach, give peach the power, else try and move/fall. virtual because 
inherited from actor. 


virtual void bonk() {};

all goodies do nothing when bonked. 

////////////////////////////////////////
///		STRUCTURES
////////////////////////////////////////

virtual void doSomething() {};

structures do nothing during a tick. virtual because inherited from actor. 


virtual void bonk() = 0;

structures do different things when bonked. makes structure an abstract class because can not have 
a general type of structure.


virtual void bonk(); //BLOCK 

releases goodie if block holds one, does nothing otherwise. virtual because inherited from structure


virtual void bonk(); //PIPE

pipe doesn't do anything when bonked. virtual because inherited from structure


/////////////////////////////////
///	   LEVELENDR
/////////////////////////////////

virtual void doSomething();

if overlapping peach, tell studentworld that level/game is over according to level endr type, else nothing. 
virtual because inherited from actor. 


virtual void endFunction() = 0;

different levelendrs have different things they end when triggered. pure virtual to make level endr an abstract
class. 


virtual void bonk();

levelendr's do nothing when bonked. virtual because inherited from actor. 


////////////////////////////////////////
///		PROJECTILES
////////////////////////////////////////

virtual void doSomething();

projectile moves in its direction, bonk something if overlapping with something. virtual because inherited from actor


virtual void bonk() {};

projectiles do nothing when bonked. virtual because inherited from actor. 



2. no known errors 


3. I decided to have everythink bonk itself when it overlaps peach instead of peach bonking everything else so that
I didn't have to determine what peach was overlapping with and looping through the vector of actors all the time to see if
peach was overlapping anything. 

I also used stringstreams to make the zeros in the point display.
