## Project Introduction

NachenGames corporate spies have learned that SmallSoft is planning to release a new
video game called Super Peach Sisters, a sequel to Super Mario Brothers, and would like
you to program an exact copy so NachenGames can beat SmallSoft to the market. To
help you, NachenGames corporate spies have managed to steal a prototype Super Peach
Sisters executable file and several source files from the SmallSoft headquarters, so you
can see exactly how your version of the game must work (see posted executable file) and
even get a head start on the programming. Of course, such behavior would never be
appropriate in real life, but for this project, you’ll be a programming villain.
Super Peach Sisters is set in the Mushroom Queendom, fictional land of crazy creatures
like fire-breathing piranhas, koopas and goombas. Unfortunately, last week Mario was
taken hostage by the evil greenhouse gas producer named Yerac Grebnehcan (who is well
known for producing huge amounts of methane), and Peach must face a number of
increasingly difficult levels to rescue him.

Each level contains a number of challenges, which include dangerous koopas, goombas,
and fire-breathing Piranhas that grow from pipes. Peach must avoid or destroy these
creatures to reach the flag on each level, which takes her to the next level. Once Peach
reaches the final level, she must then get to Mario to save him and win the game. Each
level contains a number of goodies that Peach can reveal by bonking her head against
blocks. These goodies include Stars (which grant invincibility to Peach), Mushrooms
(which enable Peach to double her jumping height), and Flowers which enables Peach to
shoot fireballs at her opponents.

More details about the project requirements can be found in the [project spec](./project_spec.pdf).
